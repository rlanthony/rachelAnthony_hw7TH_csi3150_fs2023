# CSI 3150 Take Home Assignment 7

## Directions:

Write a React Component for a “User Sign Up” functionality (and take snapshot of your code
editor for the component or submit the github repo link), where the user will be presented with
a form with the following form fields:
a. User Full Name
b. User’s desired username
c. User email
d. User Address, and
e. User Phone Number
Once the user inputs all the data and submits the form, console log the user inputs to the
browser (and take a snapshot of it for proof of work and include it in your submission
document) to verify that your component is able to capture the user input and store it
temporarily in your program.
